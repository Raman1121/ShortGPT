       " 'text': ['\\n\\n\\n\\nProduced by Q Myers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWALKING\\n\\nby Henry David Thoreau\\n\\n\\nI wish to speak a word for Nature, for absolute freedom and wildness, as\\ncontrasted with a freedom and culture merely civil--to regard man as\\nan inhabitant, or a part and parcel of Nature, rather than a member\\nof society. I wish to make an extreme statement, if so I may make\\nan emphatic one, for there are enough champions of civilization: the\\nminister and the school committee and every one of you will take care of\\nthat.\\n\\n\\n\\nI have met with but one or two persons in the course of my life who\\nunderstood the art of Walking, that is, of taking walks--who had a\\ngenius, so to speak, for SAUNTERING, which word is beautifully derived\\n\"from idle people who roved about the country, in the Middle Ages, and\\nasked charity, under pretense of going a la Sainte Terre,\" to the Holy\\nLand, till the children exclaimed, \"There goes a Sainte-Terrer,\" a\\nSaunterer, a Holy-Lander. They who never go to the Holy Land in their\\nwalks, as they pretend, are indeed mere idlers and vagabonds; but they\\nwho do go there are saunterers in the good sense, such as I mean. Some,\\nhowever, would derive the word from sans terre without land or a home,\\nwhich, therefore, in the good sense, will mean, having no particular\\nhome, but equally at home everywhere. For this is the secret of\\nsuccessful sauntering. He who sits still in a house all the time may be\\nthe greatest vagrant of all; but the saunterer, in the good sense, is\\nno more vagrant than the meandering river, which is all the while\\nsedulously seeking the shortest course to the sea. But I prefer the\\nfirst, which, indeed, is the most probable derivation. For every walk is\\na sort of crusade, preached by some Peter the Hermit in us, to go forth\\nand reconquer this Holy Land from the hands of the Infidels.\\n\\nIt is true, we are but faint-hearted crusaders, even the walkers,\\nnowadays, who undertake no persevering, never-ending enterprises. Our\\nexpeditions are but tours, and come round again at evening to the old\\nhearth-side from which we set out. Half the walk is but retracing our\\nsteps. We should go forth on the shortest walk, perchance, in the\\nspirit of undying adventure, never to return--prepared to send back\\nour embalmed hearts only as relics to our desolate kingdoms. If you are\\nready to leave father and mother, and brother and sister, and wife\\nand child and friends, and never see them again--if you have paid your\\ndebts, and made your will, and settled all your affairs, and are a free\\nman--then you are ready for a walk.\\n\\nTo come down to my own experience, my companion and I, for I sometimes\\nhave a companion, take pleasure in fancying ourselves knights of a new,\\nor rather an old, order--not Equestrians or Chevaliers, not Ritters or\\nRiders, but Walkers, a still more ancient and honorable class, I trust.\\nThe Chivalric and heroic spirit which once belonged to the Rider seems\\nnow to reside in, or perchance to have subsided into, the Walker--not\\nthe Knight, but Walker, Errant. He is a sort of fourth estate, outside\\nof Church and State and People.\\n\\nWe have felt that we almost alone hereabouts practiced this noble art;\\nthough, to tell the truth, at least if their own assertions are to be\\nreceived, most of my townsmen would fain walk sometimes, as I do, but\\nthey cannot. No wealth can buy the requisite leisure, freedom, and\\nindependence which are the capital in this profession. It comes only\\nby the grace of God. It requires a direct dispensation from Heaven\\nto become a walker. You must be born into the family of the Walkers.\\nAmbulator nascitur, non fit. Some of my townsmen, it is true, can\\nremember and have described to me some walks which they took ten years\\nago, in which they were so blessed as to lose themselves for half\\nan hour in the woods; but I know very well that they have confined\\nthemselves to the highway ever since, whatever pretensions they may make\\nto belong to this select class. No doubt they were elevated for a moment\\nas by the reminiscence of a previous state of existence, when even they\\nwere foresters and outlaws.\\n\\n         \"When he came to grene wode,\\n            In a mery mornynge,\\n          There he herde the notes small\\n            Of byrdes mery syngynge.\\n\\n         \"It is ferre gone, sayd Robyn,\\n            That I was last here;\\n          Me Lyste a lytell for to shote\\n            At the donne dere.\"\\n\\nI think that I cannot preserve my health and spirits, unless I spend\\nfour hours a day at least--and it is commonly more than that--sauntering\\nthrough the woods and over the hills and fields, absolutely free from\\nall worldly engagements. You may safely say, A penny for your thoughts,\\nor a thousand pounds. When sometimes I am reminded that the mechanics\\nand shopkeepers stay in their shops not only all the forenoon, but all\\nthe afternoon too, sitting with crossed legs, so many of them--as if the\\nlegs were made to sit upon, and not to stand or walk upon--I think that\\nthey deserve some credit for not having all committed suicide long ago.\\n\\nI, who cannot stay in my chamber for a single day without acquiring some\\nrust, and when sometimes I have stolen forth for a walk at the eleventh\\nhour, or four o\\'clock in the afternoon, too late to redeem the day,\\nwhen the shades of night were already beginning to be mingled with the\\ndaylight, have felt as if I had committed some sin to be atoned for,--I\\nconfess that I am astonished at the power of endurance, to say nothing\\nof the moral insensibility, of my neighbors who confine themselves to\\nshops and offices the whole day for weeks and months, aye, and years\\nalmost together. I know not what manner of stuff they are of--sitting\\nthere now at three o\\'clock in the afternoon, as if it were three o\\'clock\\nin the morning. Bonaparte may talk of the three-o\\'clock-in-the-morning\\ncourage, but it is nothing to the courage which can sit down cheerfully\\nat this hour in the afternoon over against one\\'s self whom you have\\nknown all the morning, to starve out a garrison to whom you are bound\\nby such strong ties of sympathy. I wonder that about this time, or say\\nbetween four and five o\\'clock in the afternoon, too late for the morning\\npapers and too early for the evening ones, there is not a general\\nexplosion heard up and down the street, scattering a legion of\\nantiquated and house-bred notions and whims to the four winds for an\\nairing-and so the evil cure itself.\\n\\nHow womankind, who are confined to the house still more than men, stand\\nit I do not know; but I have ground to suspect that most of them do not\\nSTAND it at all. When, early in a summer afternoon, we have been shaking\\nthe dust of the village from the skirts of our garments, making haste\\npast those houses with purely Doric or Gothic fronts, which have such\\nan air of repose about them, my companion whispers that probably about\\nthese times their occupants are all gone to bed. Then it is that I\\nappreciate the beauty and the glory of architecture, which itself never\\nturns in, but forever stands out and erect, keeping watch over the\\nslumberers.\\n\\nNo doubt temperament, and, above all, age, have a good deal to do with\\nit. As a man grows older, his ability to sit still and follow indoor\\noccupations increases. He grows vespertinal in his habits as the\\nevening of life approaches, till at last he comes forth only just before\\nsundown, and gets all the walk that he requires in half an hour.\\n\\nBut the walking of which I speak has nothing in it akin to taking\\nexercise, as it is called, as the sick take medicine at stated hours--as\\nthe Swinging of dumb-bells or chairs; but is itself the enterprise and\\nadventure of the day. If you would get exercise, go in search of the\\nsprings of life. Think of a man\\'s swinging dumbbells for his health,\\nwhen those springs are bubbling up in far-off pastures unsought by him!\\n\\nMoreover, you must walk like a camel, which is said to be the only beast\\nwhich ruminates when walking. When a traveler asked Wordsworth\\'s servant\\nto show him her master\\'s study, she answered, \"Here is his library, but\\nhis study is out of doors.\"\\n\\nLiving much out of doors, in the sun and wind, will no doubt produce\\na certain roughness of character--will cause a thicker cuticle to grow\\nover some of the finer qualities of our nature, as on the face and\\nhands, or as severe manual labor robs the hands of some of their\\ndelicacy of touch. So staying in the house, on the other hand, may\\nproduce a softness and smoothness, not to say thinness of skin,\\naccompanied by an increased sensibility to certain impressions. Perhaps\\nwe should be more susceptible to some influences important to our\\nintellectual and moral growth, if the sun had shone and the wind blown\\non us a little less; and no doubt it is a nice matter to proportion\\nrightly the thick and thin skin. But methinks that is a scurf that will\\nfall off fast enough--that the natural remedy is to be found in the\\nproportion which the night bears to the day, the winter to the summer,\\nthought to experience. There will be so much the more air and sunshine\\nin our thoughts. The callous palms of the laborer are conversant with\\nfiner tissues of self-respect and heroism, whose touch thrills the\\nheart, than the languid fingers of idleness. That is mere sentimentality\\nthat lies abed by day and thinks itself white, far from the tan and\\ncallus of experience.\\n\\nWhen we walk, we naturally go to the fields and woods: what would become\\nof us, if we walked only in a garden or a mall? Even some sects\\nof philosophers have felt the necessity of importing the woods to\\nthemselves, since they did not go to the woods. \"They planted groves and\\nwalks of Platanes,\" where they took subdiales ambulationes in porticos\\nopen to the air. Of course it is of no use to direct our steps to the\\nwoods, if they do not carry us thither. I am alarmed when it happens\\nthat I have walked a mile into the woods bodily, without getting there\\nin spirit. In my afternoon walk I would fain forget all my morning\\noccupations and my obligations to Society. But it sometimes happens that\\nI cannot easily shake off the village. The thought of some work will run\\nin my head and I am not where my body is--I am out of my senses. In\\nmy walks I would fain return to my senses. What business have I in the\\nwoods, if I am thinking of something out of the woods? I suspect myself,\\nand cannot help a shudder when I find myself so implicated even in what\\nare called good works--for this may sometimes happen.\\n\\nMy vicinity affords many good walks; and though for so many years I have\\nwalked almost every day, and sometimes for several days together, I have\\nnot yet exhausted them. An absolutely new prospect is a great happiness,\\nand I can still get this any afternoon. Two or three hours\\' walking\\nwill carry me to as strange a country as I expect ever to see. A single\\nfarmhouse which I had not seen before is sometimes as good as the\\ndominions of the King of Dahomey. There is in fact a sort of harmony\\ndiscoverable between the capabilities of the landscape within a circle\\nof ten miles\\' radius, or the limits of an afternoon walk, and the\\nthreescore years and ten of human life. It will never become quite\\nfamiliar to you.\\n\\nNowadays almost all man\\'s improvements, so called, as the building of\\nhouses and the cutting down of the forest and of all large trees, simply\\ndeform the landscape, and make it more and more tame and cheap. A people\\nwho would begin by burning the fences and let the forest stand! I saw\\nthe fences half consumed, their ends lost in the middle of the prairie,\\nand some worldly miser with a surveyor looking after his bounds, while\\nheaven had taken place around him, and he did not see the angels\\ngoing to and fro, but was looking for an old post-hole in the midst of\\nparadise. I looked again, and saw him standing in the middle of a boggy\\nStygian fen, surrounded by devils, and he had found his bounds without\\na doubt, three little stones, where a stake had been driven, and looking\\nnearer, I saw that the Prince of Darkness was his surveyor.\\n\\nI can easily walk ten, fifteen, twenty, any number of miles, commencing\\nat my own door, without going by any house, without crossing a road\\nexcept where the fox and the mink do: first along by the river, and then\\nthe brook, and then the meadow and the woodside. There are square miles\\nin my vicinity which have no inhabitant. From many a hill I can see\\ncivilization and the abodes of man afar. The farmers and their works\\nare scarcely more obvious than woodchucks and their burrows. Man and\\nhis affairs, church and state and school, trade and commerce, and\\nmanufactures and agriculture even politics, the most alarming of them\\nall--I am pleased to see how little space they occupy in the landscape.\\nPolitics is but a narrow field, and that still narrower highway yonder\\nleads to it. I sometimes direct the traveler thither. If you would go to\\nthe political world, follow the great road--follow that market-man, keep\\nhis dust in your eyes, and it will lead you straight to it; for it, too,\\nhas its place merely, and does not occupy all space. I pass from it as\\nfrom a bean field into the forest, and it is forgotten. In one half-hour\\nI can walk off to some portion of the earth\\'s surface where a man does\\nnot stand from one year\\'s end to another, and there, consequently,\\npolitics are not, for they are but as the cigar-smoke of a man.\\n\\nThe village is the place to which the roads tend, a sort of expansion of\\nthe highway, as a lake of a river. It is the body of which roads are\\nthe arms and legs--a trivial or quadrivial place, the thoroughfare and\\nordinary of travelers. The word is from the Latin villa which together\\nwith via, a way, or more anciently ved and vella, Varro derives from\\nveho, to carry, because the villa is the place to and from which things\\nare carried. They who got their living by teaming were said vellaturam\\nfacere. Hence, too, the Latin word vilis and our vile, also villain.\\nThis suggests what kind of degeneracy villagers are liable to. They\\nare wayworn by the travel that goes by and over them, without traveling\\nthemselves.\\n\\nSome do not walk at all; others walk in the highways; a few walk across\\nlots. Roads are made for horses and men of business. I do not travel\\nin them much, comparatively, because I am not in a hurry to get to any\\ntavern or grocery or livery-stable or depot to which they lead. I am\\na good horse to travel, but not from choice a roadster. The\\nlandscape-painter uses the figures of men to mark a road. He would not\\nmake that use of my figure. I walk out into a nature such as the old\\nprophets and poets, Menu, Moses, Homer, Chaucer, walked in. You may\\nname it America, but it is not America; neither Americus Vespueius,\\nnor Columbus, nor the rest were the discoverers of it. There is a truer\\namount of it in mythology than in any history of America, so called,\\nthat I have seen.\\n\\nHowever, there are a few old roads that may be trodden with profit, as\\nif they led somewhere now that they are nearly discontinued. There\\nis the Old Marlborough Road, which does not go to Marlborough now,\\nme-thinks, unless that is Marlborough where it carries me. I am the\\nbolder to speak of it here, because I presume that there are one or two\\nsuch roads in every town.\\n\\n\\n\\n       THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD\\n\\n        Where they once dug for money,\\n        But never found any;\\n        Where sometimes Martial Miles\\n        Singly files,\\n        And Elijah Wood,\\n        I fear for no good:\\n        No other man,\\n        Save Elisha Dugan--\\n        O man of wild habits,\\n        Partridges and rabbits\\n        Who hast no cares\\n        Only to set snares,\\n        Who liv\\'st all alone,\\n        Close to the bone\\n        And where life is sweetest\\n        Constantly eatest.\\n     When the spring stirs my blood\\n      With the instinct to travel,\\n      I can get enough gravel\\n     On the Old Marlborough Road.\\n        Nobody repairs it,\\n        For nobody wears it;\\n        It is a living way,\\n        As the Christians say.\\n     Not many there be\\n      Who enter therein,\\n     Only the guests of the\\n      Irishman Quin.\\n     What is it, what is it\\n      But a direction out there,\\n     And the bare possibility\\n        Of going somewhere?\\n        Great guide-boards of stone,\\n        But travelers none;\\n        Cenotaphs of the towns\\n        Named on their crowns.\\n        It is worth going to see\\n\\n        Where you MIGHT be.\\n        What king\\n        Did the thing,\\n        I am still wondering;\\n        Set up how or when,\\n        By what selectmen,\\n        Gourgas or Lee,\\n        Clark or Darby?\\n        They\\'re a great endeavor\\n        To be something forever;\\n        Blank tablets of stone,\\n        Where a traveler might groan,\\n        And in one sentence\\n        Grave all that is known\\n        Which another might read,\\n        In his extreme need.\\n        I know one or two\\n        Lines that would do,\\n        Literature that might stand\\n        All over the land\\n        Which a man could remember\\n        Till next December,\\n        And read again in the spring,\\n        After the thawing.\\n     If with fancy unfurled\\n      You leave your abode,\\n     You may go round the world\\n      By the Old Marlborough Road.\\n\\nAt present, in this vicinity, the best part of the land is not private\\nproperty; the landscape is not owned, and the walker enjoys comparative\\nfreedom. But possibly the day will come when it will be partitioned off\\ninto so-called pleasure-grounds, in which a few will take a narrow and\\nexclusive pleasure only--when fences shall be multiplied, and man-traps\\nand other engines invented to confine men to the PUBLIC road, and\\nwalking over the surface of God\\'s earth shall be construed to mean\\ntrespassing on some gentleman\\'s grounds. To enjoy a thing exclusively\\nis commonly to exclude yourself from the true enjoyment of it. Let us\\nimprove our opportunities, then, before the evil days come.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is it that makes it so hard sometimes to determine whither we will\\nwalk? I believe that there is a subtle magnetism in Nature, which, if we\\nunconsciously yield to it, will direct us aright. It is not indifferent\\nto us which way we walk. There is a right way; but we are very liable\\nfrom heedlessness and stupidity to take the wrong one. We would fain\\ntake that walk, never yet taken by us through this actual world, which\\nis perfectly symbolical of the path which we love to travel in the\\ninterior and ideal world; and sometimes, no doubt, we find it difficult\\nto choose our direction, because it does not yet exist distinctly in our\\nidea.\\n\\nWhen I go out of the house for a walk, uncertain as yet whither I will\\nbend my steps, and submit myself to my instinct to decide for me,\\nI find, strange and whimsical as it may seem, that I finally and\\ninevitably settle southwest, toward some particular wood or meadow\\nor deserted pasture or hill in that direction. My needle is slow to\\nsettle,--varies a few degrees, and does not always point due southwest,\\nit is true, and it has good authority for this variation, but it always\\nsettles between west and south-southwest. The future lies that way to\\nme, and the earth seems more unexhausted and richer on that side.\\nThe outline which would bound my walks would be, not a circle, but a\\nparabola, or rather like one of those cometary orbits which have been\\nthought to be non-returning curves, in this case opening westward, in\\nwhich my house occupies the place of the sun. I turn round and round\\nirresolute sometimes for a quarter of an hour, until I decide, for a\\nthousandth time, that I will walk into the southwest or west. Eastward I\\ngo only by force; but westward I go free. Thither no business leads\\nme. It is hard for me to believe that I shall find fair landscapes or\\nsufficient wildness and freedom behind the eastern horizon. I am not\\nexcited by the prospect of a walk thither; but I believe that the forest\\nwhich I see in the western horizon stretches uninterruptedly toward\\nthe setting sun, and there are no towns nor cities in it of enough\\nconsequence to disturb me. Let me live where I will, on this side is the\\ncity, on that the wilderness, and ever I am leaving the city more and\\nmore, and withdrawing into the wilderness. I should not lay so much\\nstress on this fact, if I did not believe that something like this is\\nthe prevailing tendency of my countrymen. I must walk toward Oregon, and\\nnot toward Europe. And that way the nation is moving, and I may say that\\nmankind progress from east to west. Within a few years we have witnessed\\nthe phenomenon of a southeastward migration, in the settlement of\\nAustralia; but this affects us as a retrograde movement, and, judging\\nfrom the moral and physical character of the first generation of\\nAustralians, has not yet proved a successful experiment. The eastern\\nTartars think that there is nothing west beyond Thibet. \"The world ends\\nthere,\" say they; \"beyond there is nothing but a shoreless sea.\" It is\\nunmitigated East where they live.\\n\\nWe go eastward to realize history and study the works of art and\\nliterature, retracing the steps of the race; we go westward as into the\\nfuture, with a spirit of enterprise and adventure. The Atlantic is a\\nLethean stream, in our passage over which we have had an opportunity\\nto forget the Old World and its institutions. If we do not succeed\\nthis time, there is perhaps one more chance for the race left before\\nit arrives on the banks of the Styx; and that is in the Lethe of the\\nPacific, which is three times as wide.\\n\\nI know not how significant it is, or how far it is an evidence of\\nsingularity, that an individual should thus consent in his pettiest walk\\nwith the general movement of the race; but I know that something akin\\nto the migratory instinct in birds and quadrupeds--which, in some\\ninstances, is known to have affected the squirrel tribe, impelling them\\nto a general and mysterious movement, in which they were seen, say some,\\ncrossing the broadest rivers, each on its particular chip, with its tail\\nraised for a sail, and bridging narrower streams with their dead--that\\nsomething like the furor which affects the domestic cattle in the\\nspring, and which is referred to a worm in their tails,--affects both\\nnations and individuals, either perennially or from time to time. Not\\na flock of wild geese cackles over our town, but it to some extent\\nunsettles the value of real estate here, and, if I were a broker, I\\nshould probably take that disturbance into account.\\n\\n   \"Than longen folk to gon on pilgrimages,\\n   And palmeres for to seken strange strondes.\"\\n\\nEvery sunset which I witness inspires me with the desire to go to a West\\nas distant and as fair as that into which the sun goes down. He appears\\nto migrate westward daily, and tempt us to follow him. He is the Great\\nWestern Pioneer whom the nations follow. We dream all night of those\\nmountain-ridges in the horizon, though they may be of vapor only, which\\nwere last gilded by his rays. The island of Atlantis, and the islands\\nand gardens of the Hesperides, a sort of terrestrial paradise, appear\\nto have been the Great West of the ancients, enveloped in mystery and\\npoetry. Who has not seen in imagination, when looking into the sunset\\nsky, the gardens of the Hesperides, and the foundation of all those\\nfables?\\n\\nColumbus felt the westward tendency more strongly than any before. He\\nobeyed it, and found a New World for Castile and Leon. The herd of men\\nin those days scented fresh pastures from afar,\\n\\n  \"And now the sun had stretched out all the hills,\\n  And now was dropped into the western bay;\\n  At last HE rose, and twitched his mantle blue;\\n  Tomorrow to fresh woods and pastures new.\"\\n\\nWhere on the globe can there be found an area of equal extent with that\\noccupied by the bulk of our States, so fertile and so rich and varied in\\nits productions, and at the same time so habitable by the European, as\\nthis is? Michaux, who knew but part of them, says that \"the species of\\nlarge trees are much more numerous in North America than in Europe; in\\nthe United States there are more than one hundred and forty species that\\nexceed thirty feet in height; in France there are but thirty that attain\\nthis size.\" Later botanists more than confirm his observations. Humboldt\\ncame to America to realize his youthful dreams of a tropical vegetation,\\nand he beheld it in its greatest perfection in the primitive forests of\\nthe Amazon, the most gigantic wilderness on the earth, which he has so\\neloquently described. The geographer Guyot, himself a European, goes\\nfarther--farther than I am ready to follow him; yet not when he says:\\n\"As the plant is made for the animal, as the vegetable world is made for\\nthe animal world, America is made for the man of the Old World.... The\\nman of the Old World sets out upon his way. Leaving the highlands of\\nAsia, he descends from station to station towards Europe. Each of his\\nsteps is marked by a new civilization superior to the preceding, by a\\ngreater power of development. Arrived at the Atlantic, he pauses on the\\nshore of this unknown ocean, the bounds of which he knows not, and turns\\nupon his footprints for an instant.\" When he has exhausted the rich soil\\nof Europe, and reinvigorated himself, \"then recommences his adventurous\\ncareer westward as in the earliest ages.\" So far Guyot.\\n\\nFrom this western impulse coming in contact with the barrier of the\\nAtlantic sprang the commerce and enterprise of modern times. The younger\\nMichaux, in his Travels West of the Alleghanies in 1802, says that the\\ncommon inquiry in the newly settled West was, \"\\'From what part of\\nthe world have you come?\\' As if these vast and fertile regions would\\nnaturally be the place of meeting and common country of all the\\ninhabitants of the globe.\"\\n\\nTo use an obsolete Latin word, I might say, Ex Oriente lux; ex Occidente\\nFRUX. From the East light; from the West fruit.\\n\\nSir Francis Head, an English traveler and a Governor-General of Canada,\\ntells us that \"in both the northern and southern hemispheres of the New\\nWorld, Nature has not only outlined her works on a larger scale, but has\\npainted the whole picture with brighter and more costly colors than she\\nused in delineating and in beautifying the Old World.... The heavens of\\nAmerica appear infinitely higher, the sky is bluer, the air is fresher,\\nthe cold is intenser, the moon looks larger, the stars are brighter the\\nthunder is louder, the lightning is vivider, the wind is stronger,\\nthe rain is heavier, the mountains are higher, the rivers longer, the\\nforests bigger, the plains broader.\" This statement will do at least\\nto set against Buffon\\'s account of this part of the world and its\\nproductions.\\n\\nLinnaeus said long ago, \"Nescio quae facies laeta, glabra plantis\\nAmericanis\" (I know not what there is of joyous and smooth in the aspect\\nof American plants); and I think that in this country there are no,\\nor at most very few, Africanae bestiae, African beasts, as the Romans\\ncalled them, and that in this respect also it is peculiarly fitted for\\nthe habitation of man. We are told that within three miles of the\\ncenter of the East-Indian city of Singapore, some of the inhabitants\\nare annually carried off by tigers; but the traveler can lie down in\\nthe woods at night almost anywhere in North America without fear of wild\\nbeasts.\\n\\nThese are encouraging testimonies. If the moon looks larger here than\\nin Europe, probably the sun looks larger also. If the heavens of America\\nappear infinitely higher, and the stars brighter, I trust that these\\nfacts are symbolical of the height to which the philosophy and poetry\\nand religion of her inhabitants may one day soar. At length, perchance,\\nthe immaterial heaven will appear as much higher to the American mind,\\nand the intimations that star it as much brighter. For I believe that\\nclimate does thus react on man--as there is something in the mountain\\nair that feeds the spirit and inspires. Will not man grow to greater\\nperfection intellectually as well as physically under these influences?\\nOr is it unimportant how many foggy days there are in his life? I trust\\nthat we shall be more imaginative, that our thoughts will be clearer,\\nfresher, and more ethereal, as our sky--our understanding more\\ncomprehensive and broader, like our plains--our intellect generally on a\\ngrander scale, like our thunder and lightning, our rivers and mountains\\nand forests-and our hearts shall even correspond in breadth and depth\\nand grandeur to our inland seas. Perchance there will appear to the\\ntraveler something, he knows not what, of laeta and glabra, of joyous\\nand serene, in our very faces. Else to what end does the world go on,\\nand why was America discovered?\\n\\nTo Americans I hardly need to say--\\n\\n\"Westward the star of empire takes its way.\"\\n\\nAs a true patriot, I should be ashamed to think that Adam in paradise\\nwas more favorably situated on the whole than the backwoodsman in this\\ncountry.\\n\\nOur sympathies in Massachusetts are not confined to New England; though\\nwe may be estranged from the South, we sympathize with the West. There\\nis the home of the younger sons, as among the Scandinavians they took to\\nthe sea for their inheritance. It is too late to be studying Hebrew; it\\nis more important to understand even the slang of today.\\n\\nSome months ago I went to see a panorama of the Rhine. It was like\\na dream of the Middle Ages. I floated down its historic stream in\\nsomething more than imagination, under bridges built by the Romans, and\\nrepaired by later heroes, past cities and castles whose very names were\\nmusic to my ears, and each of which was the subject of a legend. There\\nwere Ehrenbreitstein and Rolandseck and Coblentz, which I knew only in\\nhistory. They were ruins that interested me chiefly. There seemed to\\ncome up from its waters and its vine-clad hills and valleys a hushed\\nmusic as of Crusaders departing for the Holy Land. I floated along under\\nthe spell of enchantment, as if I had been transported to an heroic age,\\nand breathed an atmosphere of chivalry.\\n\\nSoon after, I went to see a panorama of the Mississippi, and as I\\nworked my way up the river in the light of today, and saw the steamboats\\nwooding up, counted the rising cities, gazed on the fresh ruins of\\nNauvoo, beheld the Indians moving west across the stream, and, as before\\nI had looked up the Moselle, now looked up the Ohio and the Missouri and\\nheard the legends of Dubuque and of Wenona\\'s Cliff--still thinking more\\nof the future than of the past or present--I saw that this was a Rhine\\nstream of a different kind; that the foundations of castles were yet to\\nbe laid, and the famous bridges were yet to be thrown over the river;\\nand I felt that THIS WAS THE HEROIC AGE ITSELF, though we know it not,\\nfor the hero is commonly the simplest and obscurest of men.\\n\\nThe West of which I speak is but another name for the Wild; and what I\\nhave been preparing to say is, that in Wildness is the preservation of\\nthe World. Every tree sends its fibers forth in search of the Wild. The\\ncities import it at any price. Men plow and sail for it. From the\\nforest and wilderness come the tonics and barks which brace mankind. Our\\nancestors were savages. The story of Romulus and Remus being suckled by\\na wolf is not a meaningless fable. The founders of every state which has\\nrisen to eminence have drawn their nourishment and vigor from a similar\\nwild source. It was because the children of the Empire were not suckled\\nby the wolf that they were conquered and displaced by the children of\\nthe northern forests who were.\\n\\nI believe in the forest, and in the meadow, and in the night in which\\nthe corn grows. We require an infusion of hemlock, spruce or arbor\\nvitae in our tea. There is a difference between eating and drinking\\nfor strength and from mere gluttony. The Hottentots eagerly devour the\\nmarrow of the koodoo and other antelopes raw, as a matter of course.\\nSome of our northern Indians eat raw the marrow of the Arctic reindeer,\\nas well as various other parts, including the summits of the antlers, as\\nlong as they are soft. And herein, perchance, they have stolen a march\\non the cooks of Paris. They get what usually goes to feed the fire. This\\nis probably better than stall-fed beef and slaughterhouse pork to make\\na man of. Give me a wildness whose glance no civilization can endure--as\\nif we lived on the marrow of koodoos devoured raw.\\n\\nThere are some intervals which border the strain of the wood thrush,\\nto which I would migrate--wild lands where no settler has squatted; to\\nwhich, methinks, I am already acclimated.\\n\\nThe African hunter Cumming tells us that the skin of the eland, as well\\nas that of most other antelopes just killed, emits the most delicious\\nperfume of trees and grass. I would have every man so much like a wild\\nantelope, so much a part and parcel of nature, that his very person\\nshould thus sweetly advertise our senses of his presence, and remind us\\nof those parts of nature which he most haunts. I feel no disposition to\\nbe satirical, when the trapper\\'s coat emits the odor of musquash even;\\nit is a sweeter scent to me than that which commonly exhales from the\\nmerchant\\'s or the scholar\\'s garments. When I go into their wardrobes and\\nhandle their vestments, I am reminded of no grassy plains and flowery\\nmeads which they have frequented, but of dusty merchants\\' exchanges and\\nlibraries rather.\\n\\nA tanned skin is something more than respectable, and perhaps olive is\\na fitter color than white for a man--a denizen of the woods. \"The pale\\nwhite man!\" I do not wonder that the African pitied him. Darwin the\\nnaturalist says, \"A white man bathing by the side of a Tahitian was like\\na plant bleached by the gardener\\'s art, compared with a fine, dark green\\none, growing vigorously in the open fields.\"\\n\\nBen Jonson exclaims,--\\n\\n \"How near to good is what is fair!\"\\n\\nSo I would say,--\\n\\n \"How near to good is what is WILD!\"\\n\\nLife consists with wildness. The most alive is the wildest. Not yet\\nsubdued to man, its presence refreshes him. One who pressed forward\\nincessantly and never rested from his labors, who grew fast and made\\ninfinite demands on life, would always find himself in a new country\\nor wilderness, and surrounded by the raw material of life. He would be\\nclimbing over the prostrate stems of primitive forest trees.\\n\\nHope and the future for me are not in lawns and cultivated fields, not\\nin towns and cities, but in the impervious and quaking swamps. When,\\nformerly, I have analyzed my partiality for some farm which I had\\ncontemplated purchasing, I have frequently found that I was attracted\\nsolely by a few square rods of impermeable and unfathomable bog--a\\nnatural sink in one corner of it. That was the jewel which dazzled me.\\nI derive more of my subsistence from the swamps which surround my native\\ntown than from the cultivated gardens in the village. There are no\\nricher parterres to my eyes than the dense beds of dwarf andromeda\\n(Cassandra calyculata) which cover these tender places on the earth\\'s\\nsurface. Botany cannot go farther than tell me the names of the shrubs\\nwhich grow there--the high blueberry, panicled andromeda, lambkill,\\nazalea, and rhodora--all standing in the quaking sphagnum. I often\\nthink that I should like to have my house front on this mass of dull red\\nbushes, omitting other flower plots and borders, transplanted spruce\\nand trim box, even graveled walks--to have this fertile spot under my\\nwindows, not a few imported barrowfuls of soil only to cover the sand\\nwhich was thrown out in digging the cellar. Why not put my house, my\\nparlor, behind this plot, instead of behind that meager assemblage of\\ncuriosities, that poor apology for a Nature and Art, which I call my\\nfront yard? It is an effort to clear up and make a decent appearance\\nwhen the carpenter and mason have departed, though done as much for the\\npasser-by as the dweller within. The most tasteful front-yard fence was\\nnever an agreeable object of study to me; the most elaborate ornaments,\\nacorn tops, or what not, soon wearied and disgusted me. Bring your sills\\nup to the very edge of the swamp, then (though it may not be the best\\nplace for a dry cellar), so that there be no access on that side to\\ncitizens. Front yards are not made to walk in, but, at most, through,\\nand you could go in the back way.\\n\\nYes, though you may think me perverse, if it were proposed to me to\\ndwell in the neighborhood of the most beautiful garden that ever human\\nart contrived, or else of a Dismal Swamp, I should certainly decide for\\nthe swamp. How vain, then, have been all your labors, citizens, for me!\\n\\nMy spirits infallibly rise in proportion to the outward dreariness. Give\\nme the ocean, the desert, or the wilderness! In the desert, pure air\\nand solitude compensate for want of moisture and fertility. The traveler\\nBurton says of it--\"Your MORALE improves; you become frank and cordial,\\nhospitable and single-minded.... In the desert, spirituous liquors\\nexcite only disgust. There is a keen enjoyment in a mere animal\\nexistence.\" They who have been traveling long on the steppes of Tartary\\nsay, \"On re-entering cultivated lands, the agitation, perplexity, and\\nturmoil of civilization oppressed and suffocated us; the air seemed to\\nfail us, and we felt every moment as if about to die of asphyxia.\" When\\nI would recreate myself, I seek the darkest woods the thickest and most\\ninterminable and, to the citizen, most dismal, swamp. I enter a swamp as\\na sacred place,--a sanctum sanctorum. There is the strength, the marrow,\\nof Nature. The wildwood covers the virgin mould,--and the same soil is\\ngood for men and for trees. A man\\'s health requires as many acres of\\nmeadow to his prospect as his farm does loads of muck. There are\\nthe strong meats on which he feeds. A town is saved, not more by the\\nrighteous men in it than by the woods and swamps that surround it. A\\ntownship where one primitive forest waves above while another primitive\\nforest rots below--such a town is fitted to raise not only corn and\\npotatoes, but poets and philosophers for the coming ages. In such a\\nsoil grew Homer and Confucius and the rest, and out of such a wilderness\\ncomes the Reformer eating locusts and wild honey.\\n\\nTo preserve wild animals implies generally the creation of a forest for\\nthem to dwell in or resort to. So it is with man. A hundred years ago\\nthey sold bark in our streets peeled from our own woods. In the very\\naspect of those primitive and rugged trees there was, methinks, a\\ntanning principle which hardened and consolidated the fibers of men\\'s\\nthoughts. Ah! already I shudder for these comparatively degenerate days\\nof my native village, when you cannot collect a load of bark of good\\nthickness, and we no longer produce tar and turpentine.\\n\\nThe civilized nations--Greece, Rome, England--have been sustained by the\\nprimitive forests which anciently rotted where they stand. They survive\\nas long as the soil is not exhausted. Alas for human culture! little is\\nto be expected of a nation, when the vegetable mould is exhausted, and\\nit is compelled to make manure of the bones of its fathers. There\\nthe poet sustains himself merely by his own superfluous fat, and the\\nphilosopher comes down on his marrow-bones.\\n\\nIt is said to be the task of the American \"to work the virgin soil,\" and\\nthat \"agriculture here already assumes proportions unknown everywhere\\nelse.\" I think that the farmer displaces the Indian even because he\\nredeems the meadow, and so makes himself stronger and in some respects\\nmore natural. I was surveying for a man the other day a single straight\\nline one hundred and thirty-two rods long, through a swamp at whose\\nentrance might have been written the words which Dante read over the\\nentrance to the infernal regions,--\"Leave all hope, ye that enter\"--that\\nis, of ever getting out again; where at one time I saw my employer\\nactually up to his neck and swimming for his life in his property,\\nthough it was still winter. He had another similar swamp which I\\ncould not survey at all, because it was completely under water, and\\nnevertheless, with regard to a third swamp, which I did SURVEY from a\\ndistance, he remarked to me, true to his instincts, that he would not\\npart with it for any consideration, on account of the mud which it\\ncontained. And that man intends to put a girdling ditch round the whole\\nin the course of forty months, and so redeem it by the magic of his\\nspade. I refer to him only as the type of a class.\\n\\nThe weapons with which we have gained our most important victories,\\nwhich should be handed down as heirlooms from father to son, are not the\\nsword and the lance, but the bushwhack, the turf-cutter, the spade, and\\nthe bog hoe, rusted with the blood of many a meadow, and begrimed with\\nthe dust of many a hard-fought field. The very winds blew the Indian\\'s\\ncornfield into the meadow, and pointed out the way which he had not\\nthe skill to follow. He had no better implement with which to intrench\\nhimself in the land than a clam-shell. But the farmer is armed with plow\\nand spade.\\n\\nIn literature it is only the wild that attracts us. Dullness is but\\nanother name for tameness. It is the uncivilized free and wild thinking\\nin Hamlet and the Iliad, in all the scriptures and mythologies, not\\nlearned in the schools, that delights us. As the wild duck is more swift\\nand beautiful than the tame, so is the wild--the mallard--thought, which\\n\\'mid falling dews wings its way above the fens. A truly good book is\\nsomething as natural, and as unexpectedly and unaccountably fair and\\nperfect, as a wild-flower discovered on the prairies of the West or\\nin the jungles of the East. Genius is a light which makes the darkness\\nvisible, like the lightning\\'s flash, which perchance shatters the temple\\nof knowledge itself--and not a taper lighted at the hearthstone of the\\nrace, which pales before the light of common day.\\n\\nEnglish literature, from the days of the minstrels to the Lake\\nPoets--Chaucer and Spenser and Milton, and even Shakespeare,\\nincluded--breathes no quite fresh and, in this sense, wild strain. It\\nis an essentially tame and civilized literature, reflecting Greece and\\nRome. Her wilderness is a green wood, her wild man a Robin Hood. There\\nis plenty of genial love of Nature, but not so much of Nature herself.\\nHer chronicles inform us when her wild animals, but not when the wild\\nman in her, became extinct.\\n\\nThe science of Humboldt is one thing, poetry is another thing. The\\npoet today, notwithstanding all the discoveries of science, and the\\naccumulated learning of mankind, enjoys no advantage over Homer.\\n\\nWhere is the literature which gives expression to Nature? He would be a\\npoet who could impress the winds and streams into his service, to speak\\nfor him; who nailed words to their primitive senses, as farmers drive\\ndown stakes in the spring, which the frost has heaved; who derived his\\nwords as often as he used them--transplanted them to his page with earth\\nadhering to their roots; whose words were so true and fresh and natural\\nthat they would appear to expand like the buds at the approach of\\nspring, though they lay half smothered between two musty leaves in a\\nlibrary--aye, to bloom and bear fruit there, after their kind, annually,\\nfor the faithful reader, in sympathy with surrounding Nature.\\n\\nI do not know of any poetry to quote which adequately expresses this\\nyearning for the Wild. Approached from this side, the best poetry is\\ntame. I do not know where to find in any literature, ancient or modern,\\nany account which contents me of that Nature with which even I am\\nacquainted. You will perceive that I demand something which no Augustan\\nnor Elizabethan age, which no culture, in short, can give. Mythology\\ncomes nearer to it than anything. How much more fertile a Nature,\\nat least, has Grecian mythology its root in than English literature!\\nMythology is the crop which the Old World bore before its soil was\\nexhausted, before the fancy and imagination were affected with blight;\\nand which it still bears, wherever its pristine vigor is unabated. All\\nother literatures endure only as the elms which overshadow our houses;\\nbut this is like the great dragon-tree of the Western Isles, as old as\\nmankind, and, whether that does or not, will endure as long; for the\\ndecay of other literatures makes the soil in which it thrives.\\n\\nThe West is preparing to add its fables to those of the East. The\\nvalleys of the Ganges, the Nile, and the Shine having yielded their\\ncrop, it remains to be seen what the valleys of the Amazon, the Plate,\\nthe Orinoco, the St. Lawrence, and the Mississippi will produce.\\nPerchance, when, in the course of ages, American liberty has become\\na fiction of the past--as it is to some extent a fiction of the\\npresent--the poets of the world will be inspired by American mythology.\\n\\nThe wildest dreams of wild men, even, are not the less true, though they\\nmay not recommend themselves to the sense which is most common among\\nEnglishmen and Americans today. It is not every truth that recommends\\nitself to the common sense. Nature has a place for the wild Clematis\\nas well as for the cabbage. Some expressions of truth are\\nreminiscent--others merely SENSIBLE, as the phrase is,--others\\nprophetic. Some forms of disease, even, may prophesy forms of health.\\nThe geologist has discovered that the figures of serpents, griffins,\\nflying dragons, and other fanciful embellishments of heraldry, have\\ntheir prototypes in the forms of fossil species which were extinct\\nbefore man was created, and hence \"indicate a faint and shadowy\\nknowledge of a previous state of organic existence.\" The Hindus dreamed\\nthat the earth rested on an elephant, and the elephant on a tortoise,\\nand the tortoise on a serpent; and though it may be an unimportant\\ncoincidence, it will not be out of place here to state, that a fossil\\ntortoise has lately been discovered in Asia large enough to support\\nan elephant. I confess that I am partial to these wild fancies, which\\ntranscend the order of time and development. They are the sublimest\\nrecreation of the intellect. The partridge loves peas, but not those\\nthat go with her into the pot.\\n\\nIn short, all good things are wild and free. There is something in\\na strain of music, whether produced by an instrument or by the human\\nvoice--take the sound of a bugle in a summer night, for instance--which\\nby its wildness, to speak without satire, reminds me of the cries\\nemitted by wild beasts in their native forests. It is so much of their\\nwildness as I can understand. Give me for my friends and neighbors wild\\nmen, not tame ones. The wildness of the savage is but a faint symbol of\\nthe awful ferity with which good men and lovers meet.\\n\\nI love even to see the domestic animals reassert their native\\nrights--any evidence that they have not wholly lost their original wild\\nhabits and vigor; as when my neighbor\\'s cow breaks out of her pasture\\nearly in the spring and boldly swims the river, a cold, gray tide,\\ntwenty-five or thirty rods wide, swollen by the melted snow. It is the\\nbuffalo crossing the Mississippi. This exploit confers some dignity\\non the herd in my eyes--already dignified. The seeds of instinct are\\npreserved under the thick hides of cattle and horses, like seeds in the\\nbowels of the earth, an indefinite period.\\n\\nAny sportiveness in cattle is unexpected. I saw one day a herd of a\\ndozen bullocks and cows running about and frisking in unwieldy sport,\\nlike huge rats, even like kittens. They shook their heads, raised their\\ntails, and rushed up and down a hill, and I perceived by their horns, as\\nwell as by their activity, their relation to the deer tribe. But, alas!\\na sudden loud WHOA! would have damped their ardor at once, reduced them\\nfrom venison to beef, and stiffened their sides and sinews like the\\nlocomotive. Who but the Evil One has cried \"Whoa!\" to mankind?\\nIndeed, the life of cattle, like that of many men, is but a sort of\\nlocomotiveness; they move a side at a time, and man, by his machinery,\\nis meeting the horse and the ox halfway. Whatever part the whip has\\ntouched is thenceforth palsied. Who would ever think of a SIDE of any of\\nthe supple cat tribe, as we speak of a SIDE of beef?\\n\\nI rejoice that horses and steers have to be broken before they can be\\nmade the slaves of men, and that men themselves have some wild oats\\nstill left to sow before they become submissive members of society.\\nUndoubtedly, all men are not equally fit subjects for civilization;\\nand because the majority, like dogs and sheep, are tame by inherited\\ndisposition, this is no reason why the others should have their natures\\nbroken that they may be reduced to the same level. Men are in the main\\nalike, but they were made several in order that they might be various.\\nIf a low use is to be served, one man will do nearly or quite as well as\\nanother; if a high one, individual excellence is to be regarded. Any man\\ncan stop a hole to keep the wind away, but no other man could serve so\\nrare a use as the author of this illustration did. Confucius says,--\"The\\nskins of the tiger and the leopard, when they are tanned, are as the\\nskins of the dog and the sheep tanned.\" But it is not the part of a true\\nculture to tame tigers, any more than it is to make sheep ferocious; and\\ntanning their skins for shoes is not the best use to which they can be\\nput.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen looking over a list of men\\'s names in a foreign language, as\\nof military officers, or of authors who have written on a particular\\nsubject, I am reminded once more that there is nothing in a name. The\\nname Menschikoff, for instance, has nothing in it to my ears more human\\nthan a whisker, and it may belong to a rat. As the names of the Poles\\nand Russians are to us, so are ours to them. It is as if they had been\\nnamed by the child\\'s rigmarole,--IERY FIERY ICHERY VAN, TITTLE-TOL-TAN.\\nI see in my mind a herd of wild creatures swarming over the earth,\\nand to each the herdsman has affixed some barbarous sound in his own\\ndialect. The names of men are, of course, as cheap and meaningless as\\nBOSE and TRAY, the names of dogs.\\n\\nMethinks it would be some advantage to philosophy if men were named\\nmerely in the gross, as they are known. It would be necessary only to\\nknow the genus and perhaps the race or variety, to know the individual.\\nWe are not prepared to believe that every private soldier in a Roman\\narmy had a name of his own--because we have not supposed that he had a\\ncharacter of his own.\\n\\nAt present our only true names are nicknames. I knew a boy who, from his\\npeculiar energy, was called \"Buster\" by his playmates, and this rightly\\nsupplanted his Christian name. Some travelers tell us that an Indian had\\nno name given him at first, but earned it, and his name was his fame;\\nand among some tribes he acquired a new name with every new exploit.\\nIt is pitiful when a man bears a name for convenience merely, who has\\nearned neither name nor fame.\\n\\nI will not allow mere names to make distinctions for me, but still\\nsee men in herds for all them. A familiar name cannot make a man less\\nstrange to me. It may be given to a savage who retains in secret his\\nown wild title earned in the woods. We have a wild savage in us, and\\na savage name is perchance somewhere recorded as ours. I see that my\\nneighbor, who bears the familiar epithet William or Edwin, takes it off\\nwith his jacket. It does not adhere to him when asleep or in anger, or\\naroused by any passion or inspiration. I seem to hear pronounced by some\\nof his kin at such a time his original wild name in some jaw-breaking or\\nelse melodious tongue.\\n\\n\\n\\nHere is this vast, savage, hovering mother of ours, Nature, lying all\\naround, with such beauty, and such affection for her children, as the\\nleopard; and yet we are so early weaned from her breast to society, to\\nthat culture which is exclusively an interaction of man on man--a sort\\nof breeding in and in, which produces at most a merely English nobility,\\na civilization destined to have a speedy limit.\\n\\nIn society, in the best institutions of men, it is easy to detect a\\ncertain precocity. When we should still be growing children, we are\\nalready little men. Give me a culture which imports much muck from the\\nmeadows, and deepens the soil--not that which trusts to heating manures,\\nand improved implements and modes of culture only!\\n\\nMany a poor sore-eyed student that I have heard of would grow faster,\\nboth intellectually and physically, if, instead of sitting up so very\\nlate, he honestly slumbered a fool\\'s allowance.\\n\\nThere may be an excess even of informing light. Niepce, a Frenchman,\\ndiscovered \"actinism,\" that power in the sun\\'s rays which produces a\\nchemical effect; that granite rocks, and stone structures, and statues\\nof metal \"are all alike destructively acted upon during the hours of\\nsunshine, and, but for provisions of Nature no less wonderful, would\\nsoon perish under the delicate touch of the most subtle of the agencies\\nof the universe.\" But he observed that \"those bodies which underwent\\nthis change during the daylight possessed the power of restoring\\nthemselves to their original conditions during the hours of night,\\nwhen this excitement was no longer influencing them.\" Hence it has been\\ninferred that \"the hours of darkness are as necessary to the inorganic\\ncreation as we know night and sleep are to the organic kingdom.\" Not\\neven does the moon shine every night, but gives place to darkness.\\n\\nI would not have every man nor every part of a man cultivated, any more\\nthan I would have every acre of earth cultivated: part will be tillage,\\nbut the greater part will be meadow and forest, not only serving an\\nimmediate use, but preparing a mould against a distant future, by the\\nannual decay of the vegetation which it supports.\\n\\nThere are other letters for the child to learn than those which Cadmus\\ninvented. The Spaniards have a good term to express this wild and dusky\\nknowledge--Gramatica parda--tawny grammar, a kind of mother-wit derived\\nfrom that same leopard to which I have referred.\\n\\nWe have heard of a Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge. It is\\nsaid that knowledge is power, and the like. Methinks there is equal need\\nof a Society for the Diffusion of Useful Ignorance, what we will call\\nBeautiful Knowledge, a knowledge useful in a higher sense: for what\\nis most of our boasted so-called knowledge but a conceit that we know\\nsomething, which robs us of the advantage of our actual ignorance?\\nWhat we call knowledge is often our positive ignorance; ignorance our\\nnegative knowledge. By long years of patient industry and reading of\\nthe newspapers--for what are the libraries of science but files of\\nnewspapers--a man accumulates a myriad facts, lays them up in his\\nmemory, and then when in some spring of his life he saunters abroad into\\nthe Great Fields of thought, he, as it were, goes to grass like a horse\\nand leaves all his harness behind in the stable. I would say to the\\nSociety for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, sometimes,--Go to grass.\\nYou have eaten hay long enough. The spring has come with its green crop.\\nThe very cows are driven to their country pastures before the end of\\nMay; though I have heard of one unnatural farmer who kept his cow in the\\nbarn and fed her on hay all the year round. So, frequently, the Society\\nfor the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge treats its cattle.\\n\\nA man\\'s ignorance sometimes is not only useful, but beautiful--while his\\nknowledge, so called, is oftentimes worse than useless, besides being\\nugly. Which is the best man to deal with--he who knows nothing about a\\nsubject, and, what is extremely rare, knows that he knows nothing, or he\\nwho really knows something about it, but thinks that he knows all?\\n\\nMy desire for knowledge is intermittent, but my desire to bathe my head\\nin atmospheres unknown to my feet is perennial and constant. The highest\\nthat we can attain to is not Knowledge, but Sympathy with Intelligence.\\nI do not know that this higher knowledge amounts to anything more\\ndefinite than a novel and grand surprise on a sudden revelation of the\\ninsufficiency of all that we called Knowledge before--a discovery that\\nthere are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in our\\nphilosophy. It is the lighting up of the mist by the sun. Man cannot\\nKNOW in any higher sense than this, any more than he can look serenely\\nand with impunity in the face of the sun: \"You will not perceive that,\\nas perceiving a particular thing,\" say the Chaldean Oracles.\\n\\nThere is something servile in the habit of seeking after a law which we\\nmay obey. We may study the laws of matter at and for our convenience,\\nbut a successful life knows no law. It is an unfortunate discovery\\ncertainly, that of a law which binds us where we did not know before\\nthat we were bound. Live free, child of the mist--and with respect to\\nknowledge we are all children of the mist. The man who takes the liberty\\nto live is superior to all the laws, by virtue of his relation to the\\nlawmaker. \"That is active duty,\" says the Vishnu Purana, \"which is not\\nfor our bondage; that is knowledge which is for our liberation: all\\nother duty is good only unto weariness; all other knowledge is only the\\ncleverness of an artist.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is remarkable how few events or crises there are in our histories,\\nhow little exercised we have been in our minds, how few experiences we\\nhave had. I would fain be assured that I am growing apace and rankly,\\nthough my very growth disturb this dull equanimity--though it be with\\nstruggle through long, dark, muggy nights or seasons of gloom. It would\\nbe well if all our lives were a divine tragedy even, instead of this\\ntrivial comedy or farce. Dante, Bunyan, and others appear to have been\\nexercised in their minds more than we: they were subjected to a kind of\\nculture such as our district schools and colleges do not contemplate.\\nEven Mahomet, though many may scream at his name, had a good deal more\\nto live for, aye, and to die for, than they have commonly.\\n\\nWhen, at rare intervals, some thought visits one, as perchance he is\\nwalking on a railroad, then, indeed, the cars go by without his hearing\\nthem. But soon, by some inexorable law, our life goes by and the cars\\nreturn.\\n\\n   \"Gentle breeze, that wanderest unseen,\\n   And bendest the thistles round Loira of storms,\\n   Traveler of the windy glens,\\n   Why hast thou left my ear so soon?\"\\n\\nWhile almost all men feel an attraction drawing them to society, few are\\nattracted strongly to Nature. In their reaction to Nature men appear\\nto me for the most part, notwithstanding their arts, lower than the\\nanimals. It is not often a beautiful relation, as in the case of the\\nanimals. How little appreciation of the beauty of the land-scape there\\nis among us! We have to be told that the Greeks called the world Beauty,\\nor Order, but we do not see clearly why they did so, and we esteem it at\\nbest only a curious philological fact.\\n\\nFor my part, I feel that with regard to Nature I live a sort of border\\nlife, on the confines of a world into which I make occasional and\\ntransient forays only, and my patriotism and allegiance to the state\\ninto whose territories I seem to retreat are those of a moss-trooper.\\nUnto a life which I call natural I would gladly follow even a\\nwill-o\\'-the-wisp through bogs and sloughs unimaginable, but no moon nor\\nfirefly has shown me the causeway to it. Nature is a personality so vast\\nand universal that we have never seen one of her features. The walker in\\nthe familiar fields which stretch around my native town sometimes finds\\nhimself in another land than is described in their owners\\' deeds, as it\\nwere in some faraway field on the confines of the actual Concord, where\\nher jurisdiction ceases, and the idea which the word Concord suggests\\nceases to be suggested. These farms which I have myself surveyed, these\\nbounds which I have set up, appear dimly still as through a mist; but\\nthey have no chemistry to fix them; they fade from the surface of the\\nglass, and the picture which the painter painted stands out dimly from\\nbeneath. The world with which we are commonly acquainted leaves no\\ntrace, and it will have no anniversary.\\n\\nI took a walk on Spaulding\\'s Farm the other afternoon. I saw the setting\\nsun lighting up the opposite side of a stately pine wood. Its golden\\nrays straggled into the aisles of the wood as into some noble hall. I\\nwas impressed as if some ancient and altogether admirable and shining\\nfamily had settled there in that part of the land called Concord,\\nunknown to me--to whom the sun was servant--who had not gone into\\nsociety in the village--who had not been called on. I saw their\\npark, their pleasure-ground, beyond through the wood, in Spaulding\\'s\\ncranberry-meadow. The pines furnished them with gables as they grew.\\nTheir house was not obvious to vision; the trees grew through it. I do\\nnot know whether I heard the sounds of a suppressed hilarity or not.\\nThey seemed to recline on the sunbeams. They have sons and daughters.\\nThey are quite well. The farmer\\'s cart-path, which leads directly\\nthrough their hall, does not in the least put them out, as the muddy\\nbottom of a pool is sometimes seen through the reflected skies.\\nThey never heard of Spaulding, and do not know that he is their\\nneighbor--notwithstanding I heard him whistle as he drove his team\\nthrough the house. Nothing can equal the serenity of their lives. Their\\ncoat-of-arms is simply a lichen. I saw it painted on the pines and oaks.\\nTheir attics were in the tops of the trees. They are of no politics.\\nThere was no noise of labor. I did not perceive that they were weaving\\nor spinning. Yet I did detect, when the wind lulled and hearing was done\\naway, the finest imaginable sweet musical hum,--as of a distant hive in\\nMay, which perchance was the sound of their thinking. They had no idle\\nthoughts, and no one without could see their work, for their industry\\nwas not as in knots and excrescences embayed.\\n\\nBut I find it difficult to remember them. They fade irrevocably out\\nof my mind even now while I speak, and endeavor to recall them and\\nrecollect myself. It is only after a long and serious effort to\\nrecollect my best thoughts that I become again aware of their\\ncohabitancy. If it were not for such families as this, I think I should\\nmove out of Concord.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe are accustomed to say in New England that few and fewer pigeons visit\\nus every year. Our forests furnish no mast for them. So, it would seem,\\nfew and fewer thoughts visit each growing man from year to year, for\\nthe grove in our minds is laid waste--sold to feed unnecessary fires of\\nambition, or sent to mill--and there is scarcely a twig left for them\\nto perch on. They no longer build nor breed with us. In some more genial\\nseason, perchance, a faint shadow flits across the landscape of the\\nmind, cast by the WINGS of some thought in its vernal or autumnal\\nmigration, but, looking up, we are unable to detect the substance of\\nthe thought itself. Our winged thoughts are turned to poultry. They\\nno longer soar, and they attain only to a Shanghai and Cochin-China\\ngrandeur. Those GRA-A-ATE THOUGHTS, those GRA-A-ATE men you hear of!\\n\\nWe hug the earth--how rarely we mount! Methinks we might elevate\\nourselves a little more. We might climb a tree, at least. I found my\\naccount in climbing a tree once. It was a tall white pine, on the top\\nof a hill; and though I got well pitched, I was well paid for it, for\\nI discovered new mountains in the horizon which I had never seen\\nbefore--so much more of the earth and the heavens. I might have walked\\nabout the foot of the tree for threescore years and ten, and yet I\\ncertainly should never have seen them. But, above all, I discovered\\naround me--it was near the end of June--on the ends of the topmost\\nbranches only, a few minute and delicate red conelike blossoms,\\nthe fertile flower of the white pine looking heavenward. I carried\\nstraightway to the village the topmost spire, and showed it to stranger\\njurymen who walked the streets--for it was court week--and to farmers\\nand lumber-dealers and woodchoppers and hunters, and not one had ever\\nseen the like before, but they wondered as at a star dropped down. Tell\\nof ancient architects finishing their works on the tops of columns as\\nperfectly as on the lower and more visible parts! Nature has from\\nthe first expanded the minute blossoms of the forest only toward the\\nheavens, above men\\'s heads and unobserved by them. We see only the\\nflowers that are under our feet in the meadows. The pines have developed\\ntheir delicate blossoms on the highest twigs of the wood every summer\\nfor ages, as well over the heads of Nature\\'s red children as of her\\nwhite ones; yet scarcely a farmer or hunter in the land has ever seen\\nthem.\\n\\n\\n\\nAbove all, we cannot afford not to live in the present. He is blessed\\nover all mortals who loses no moment of the passing life in remembering\\nthe past. Unless our philosophy hears the cock crow in every barnyard\\nwithin our horizon, it is belated. That sound commonly reminds us\\nthat we are growing rusty and antique in our employments and habits of\\nthoughts. His philosophy comes down to a more recent time than ours.\\nThere is something suggested by it that is a newer testament,--the\\ngospel according to this moment. He has not fallen astern; he has got\\nup early and kept up early, and to be where he is is to be in season,\\nin the foremost rank of time. It is an expression of the health and\\nsoundness of Nature, a brag for all the world,--healthiness as of a\\nspring burst forth, a new fountain of the Muses, to celebrate this last\\ninstant of time. Where he lives no fugitive slave laws are passed. Who\\nhas not betrayed his master many times since last he heard that note?\\n\\nThe merit of this bird\\'s strain is in its freedom from all\\nplaintiveness. The singer can easily move us to tears or to laughter,\\nbut where is he who can excite in us a pure morning joy? When, in\\ndoleful dumps, breaking the awful stillness of our wooden sidewalk on\\na Sunday, or, perchance, a watcher in the house of mourning, I hear a\\ncockerel crow far or near, I think to myself, \"There is one of us well,\\nat any rate,\"--and with a sudden gush return to my senses.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe had a remarkable sunset one day last November. I was walking in a\\nmeadow, the source of a small brook, when the sun at last, just before\\nsetting, after a cold, gray day, reached a clear stratum in the horizon,\\nand the softest, brightest morning sunlight fell on the dry grass and on\\nthe stems of the trees in the opposite horizon and on the leaves of the\\nshrub oaks on the hillside, while our shadows stretched long over the\\nmeadow east-ward, as if we were the only motes in its beams. It was such\\na light as we could not have imagined a moment before, and the air also\\nwas so warm and serene that nothing was wanting to make a paradise of\\nthat meadow. When we reflected that this was not a solitary phenomenon,\\nnever to happen again, but that it would happen forever and ever, an\\ninfinite number of evenings, and cheer and reassure the latest child\\nthat walked there, it was more glorious still.\\n\\nThe sun sets on some retired meadow, where no house is visible, with all\\nthe glory and splendor that it lavishes on cities, and perchance as it\\nhas never set before--where there is but a solitary marsh hawk to have\\nhis wings gilded by it, or only a musquash looks out from his cabin, and\\nthere is some little black-veined brook in the midst of the marsh, just\\nbeginning to meander, winding slowly round a decaying stump. We walked\\nin so pure and bright a light, gilding the withered grass and leaves,\\nso softly and serenely bright, I thought I had never bathed in such a\\ngolden flood, without a ripple or a murmur to it. The west side of every\\nwood and rising ground gleamed like the boundary of Elysium, and the sun\\non our backs seemed like a gentle herdsman driving us home at evening.\\n\\nSo we saunter toward the Holy Land, till one day the sun shall shine\\nmore brightly than ever he has done, shall perchance shine into our\\nminds and hearts, and light up our whole lives with a great awakening\\nlight, as warm and serene and golden as on a bankside in autumn.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Walking, by Henry David Thoreau\\n\\n*** ']}"
